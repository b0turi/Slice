in a budget:
  Two kinds of categories
    - Spend this week
    - Save this week
  Budgeted transactions are automatically added to the total for "spend this week" in their categories
  when the week their date falls within arrives

savings pools:
  - Keep track of how much is saved from past weeks in respective categories
  - Can move around money from one pool to another
  - Catch-all SAVINGS pool stores any extra money
  - removed from the "spendable total" when something is to be saved
  - Keep track of average amount of savings added to each category every week

wishlist:
  - Order wishlist transactions either by category or by importance
  - Show how many weeks it would take with current savings patterns to buy each item
  - Show same total and week count with catch-all SAVINGS added
